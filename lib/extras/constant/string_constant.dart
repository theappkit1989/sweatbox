SEXUAL ETIQUETTE AT A GAY SAUNA

Saunas are sexualised spaces.    For those that are sexually open and comfortable, they can offer an exciting and safer space in which to explore and engage with other guys.

But remember there is no such thing as Safe.   Only Safer.   And gay saunas only become a safer space if you follow the rules and guides below…..

RULES

1.No sexual contact without consent.    A simple definition of sexual contact is  no touching of the “Lips, Nips or Bits”.   You need consent before you touch someone in those areas.     See the consent guide below.
2.If we receive a complaint or complaints that you have been making sexual contact without consent, you may be asked to leave.   In very serious cases, we reserve the right to inform the police.
3.Everyone has a right to privacy.   Your sauna is likely to have a series of private spaces (cabins etc) and possibly some public play spaces.   Please respect the right to privacy of those that have chosen a private space.   Do not look over the wall or through a crack in the door.   It’s just rude.
4.Public spaces are for public fun.    If you engage in activity in a public space, you don’t get to control who else watches.   If you are unhappy or uncomfortable with others watching – or even seeking to join in - take you activity to a private space.
5.If you wish to join in an activity in a public space, consent must still be sought.   Please follow the consent guide below.
6.Dark Rooms.   If your sauna has a dark room or rooms, if you choose to enter this area, you are deemed to have consented to anonymous, non-penetrative sexual contact.     If you enter the dark room and become uncomfortable with this form of contact, you should leave immediately.
7.Glory Holes.   If your sauna has glory holes, their use implies consent to anonymous full sexual activity.   If that is not for you, you should leave the room immediately.
8.Slings.    If your sauna has slings and you find a customer lying in one, consent must still be sought.   Please see the consent guide below.
9.Consent is a two-way street.   If you feel, someone is seeking consent and you are not interested, you need to make it clear that consent has not been given.     If you consent to engage with someone and then change your mind, you must clealy withdraw consent.    Please see consent guide below.
10.If you have any concerns or issues, please make them known to the Duty Manager as soon as possible.    Remember that it is much easier for us help you and to deal with things issues if they reported to us on the night.   



CONSENT GUIDE

In gay saunas, flirtation, cruising and the seeking of consent all tend to use a non-verbal language (The Code of Silence) which makes it a very different technique to how it’s done in a gay bar, on the apps or in Sainsbury’s fresh fruit isle.

It’s therefore essential that you know how to both seek AND withhold consent in the clearest way possible - ideally in this curious, non-verbal language.    If you are at all unsure if you have clearly achieved consent.   Or if you are at all unsure if you have clearly withheld consent, then EITHER:

-do not go any further, try elsewhere or walk away

OR

-break the Code of Silence and SEEK or WITHOLD consent by speaking out loud.

STEP 1:   EYE CONTACT
-If you see someone you are attracted to and want to see if they are interested back, attempt to make eye contact.     This is not difficult.    They will know.    If they are not returning eye contact, that means they are not interested.    It happens, move on.
-If you notice someone starring at you, as subtly as possible check them out.     If you are interested, casually meet his stare a number of times until it is clear to him that you are interested.    You are ready for Step 2.     If you are not interested, either do not make or desist from eye contact.     Better yet walk away.    But be kind.    Even at this early stage, rejection can be crushing.     Try to make it a non-verbal version of ‘sorry mate, not my type’ rather than ‘urrrrgh I need to wash my eyes!’

STEP 2:	 NON-SEXUAL CONTACT (VERBAL OR PHYSICAL)
-If you have locked eyes and all is looking good, you are of course very welcome to go up to him and get some chat going.     But, unless you are American or a straight guy on the DL, this will probably feel weird.
-Most people prefer to pursue they ancient art of the casual touch.     This involves getting close enough to the guy for casual, possibly ‘accidental’ non-sexual touch (no lips, no nips, no bits!).      Ideally this should be in a non-sexual space such as a jacuzzi or steam room.    It might start with the casual contact of feet and, if not rejected, move on to a more upfront squeeze of a leg.
-If you feel your foot idly in contact with another, if you do nothing you are consenting to taking things further.    If you do not wish to consent, move your foot or move away.
-If you feel a more purposeful kind of touch (albeit non-sexual), if you allow it you are consenting.    If you do not wish to consent, the kindest way to soften the rejection is to take their hand, give it a gentle squeeze and place it away from your body.     If this is too much engagement for you, just move.      If he persists, then the strongest rejection of consent by far is to break the Code of Silence and say simply as clearly that you are not interested.    Calmly and simply saying “I don’t consent” is a very powerful rejection

STEP 3:  SEX
-If by the end of Step 2 you find yourself with a consenting partner or partners, the next stage is generally to take the party to a more conducive space.
-Particularly if you both wish to go into a private space such as a cabin, by far the safest thing for all people involved is to discuss the limits of consent before hand.
-Yes, that’s right.   Discuss.   Using your words.
-If you don’t wish to do that, you have not chosen the safest route and all parties risk misunderstandings later.
-These risks, however, are no greater than any casual sexual encounter any where around the world ever.    In fact they remain safer because they are still to take place in a space where you can certainly be heard even if not seen.
-If at any stage the activities move on to things you are not wanting, you will need to withdraw consent.     There are subtler, non-verbal ways to achieve this but they are not always successful.   They are sometimes misread.   And sometimes ignored.     If at any time you feel you wish to withdraw consent, by far the safest and most effective is to break the Code of Silence and simply say “I withdraw consent”.  Alternatively or in addition, it is wise to leave the area and, if you still feel uncomfortable or at risk, seek the help of a member of staff who can find the manager for you.

Remember guys, consent is NOT as simple as making tea.    Whoever said that it was, should stick to drinking tea and certainly not come to a gay sauna.      But it can be a LOT simpler if you stick to the two golden rules:

-If you’re not sure if you’ve been given consent, don’t do it.
-If you don’t want to do it, say ‘no’ in the clearest way possible.''';
const strTermsAndcondition = '''We want you to have a fun and relaxed time at Sweatbox but we also want to keep you safe.    Which is why we have to have some rules.   A lot of them are new and some might seem a little odd.   That’s because they’re all part of our new system of keeping drugs out of the building without the need for intrusive bag and body searches.

SWEATBOX IS A GAY MALE ADULT GYM AND SAUNA

By entering these facilities, you affirm that you are over 18, are fully aware of the nature of gay saunas and that you will not be shocked or offended by your experience, notwithstanding anything you experience which is against UK law.    If you experience anything that concerns or upsets you, in the first instance, please report this to the Duty Manager.   If you are not satisfied with his response, please feel free to report your experience to info@Sweatboxsoho.com.

8 HOUR MAXIMUM STAY PER VISIT

It doesn’t matter whether you have a 24 hour pass or an annual membership, all individual visits are limited to 8 hours with no return for 2 hours.     Any overstays are automatically charged to your bill at £3 an hour or part thereof.

SWEATBOX IS A SPA

As such you should assume that all floors are going to be wet.   The flooring we use throughout the building is certified as Non-Slip Barefoot in the Wet – the ultimate in non-slip flooring.   Nevertheless you are advised to take sensible precautions when travelling through the building – making use of handrails on stairs and looking out for changes in levels – all of which are clearly indicated. Additionally, there are informational posters throughout the building explaining the correct use of our various facilities. Please make yourself aware of these before using any of the facilities.

LIGHTING

The lighting throughout Sweatbox is lower than daylight to reflect the mood.   Nevertheless all essential areas (corridors, stairs, escape routes) are adequately lit for your safety.  If entering on a bright day, please take a few minutes to let your eyes adjust before travelling through the building. Some areas within the premises have been made exceptionally dark at the request of our customers who enjoy that experience. Please do not enter these areas if you feel uncomfortable in such places and if you do choose to enter these area you will be doing so at your own risk.

CCTV

CCTV is used throughout the premises for your safety.   However sensitive areas are restricted to a closed network and will only be reviewed in the event of a crime or an accident.  The only entity we disclose any CCTV footage to is the police and only then in the pursuit of the above. To see our full policy on how this footage is used, please click on this link.

CHEWING GUM

Sorry boys, but there’s no chewing gum allowed in the building.

ACCIDENTS.

Should you have an accident of any kind whilst on the premises please be sure to report it to the Duty Manager as soon as possible.   He will try to help you with your condition – or, if necessary, call a medic or ambulance.   He will also help you fill out an Accident Report.  It is very important that you give us as much detail as possible – especially regarding your opinion as to the cause of the accident.   This allows our manager to check the area you specify to make sure it is safe for other customers.

PASSES

All passes must be filled out fully and correctly in order to guarantee re-entry. SweatBox will only accept passes for re-entry, receipts will not be accepted in lieu of a pass. No pass will be honoured after the expiration date printed on the back of the card. You may enter the club up to the last hour of your purchased time period, but will be subject to an overstay charge of £3 an hour or part thereof, if you stay beyond that final 60 mins. Passes are non-transferable and there are no cash alternatives. In the event of any dispute, the decision of SweatBox is final. SweatBox reserves the right to alter, amend or foreclose this or any promotion without prior notice in the event that unforeseen circumstances make this unavoidable.

THE FOLLOWING RULES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO KEEP DRUGS OUT OF THE BUILDING.  GBL IS THE NUMBER ONE KILLER WITHIN THE GAY COMMUNITY.   WE ARE PART OF THAT COMMUNITY AND ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP IT OUT



THE VALUABLES BOX

At the beginning of your visit, you will be asked to put your valuables (phone, wallet, cigarettes etc) into a box for us to keep safe for you.   You can come to the bar and have access to those things as often as you want but you can’t take any of them anywhere outside of the Ground Floor. Anything left with us is done so at the customer’s risk, SweatBox does not accept liability for any property lost or damaged.



NOTHING BUT YOU AND A TOWEL ALLOWED BEYOND THE GROUND FLOOR

When you come to the bar to swap your locker key for a Spa Access Band, our staff will be checking to make sure you have nothing on you or with you.  Not hats, no shoes, no underwear or swimsuits.  No shampoo bottles.   Sorry but it’s all part of our system of keeping drugs out of the building without.

POPPERS

We do not allow open bottles of poppers beyond the Ground Floor.   You are welcome to bring your UNOPENED bottles with you.  Alternatively we sell poppers on the strict understanding that they should NOT be used within 15 minutes either side of using the steam rooms, tepidarium, IR sauna or spa bath as this can be dangerous and lead to fainting or even a heart attack.    Sweatbox takes no responsibility for your popper usage.  At our manager’s discretion, we are willing to store your poppers for you at a cost of £1 per visit.

NO RETURN TO YOUR LOCKER – OR THE MEZZANINE – DURING YOUR STAY

For the duration of your stay, your locker will remain locked and you will not have access to it.  With the exception of gym users, no-one is allowed to return to the mezzanine until they leave.   Anyone found doing so will be asked to leave.

SWEATBOX IS A PRIVATE MEMBERS CLUB

As such we have the right to ask anyone showing disrespect to our staff or other customers to leave.  The manager’s decision is final.



NOT ALL OF OUR FACILTITES ARE OPEN ALL OF THE TIME

To keep up with our high cleaning standards, certain areas will be closed every day at the following times for deep cleaning.

JACUZZI – closed between 7am and 11am.

WET SPACES – closed between 5am and 6am.

The rest of the building and facilities will remain open, avoiding as much disruption to your visit as possible.

CONSENT
All interactions at SweatBox must be consensual.  If someone is asleep they are unable to give consent.  Any touching or inappropriate behaviour with a sleeping customer will be viewed as molestation which is a crime under UK law.  The sleeping customer will be asked if they wish to press charges.

THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE OF ALL:   PLEASE TREAT EVERYONE AT SWEATBOX – STAFF AND CUSTOMERS – THE WAY YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED.    WE ARE A COMMUNITY AND WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING EACH OTHER AND BEFRIENDING EACH OTHER, NOT JUDGING OR SPREADING SHAME.

AND JUST BECAUSE YOU DON’T FANCY SOMEONE, THERE IS NO NEED TO BE RUDE OR OFF-HAND.   SOMETIMES THE BEST FRIENDSHIPS ARE FORMED BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO DON’T FANCY EACH OTHER!''';
